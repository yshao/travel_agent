RAG System for Travel Itinerary Enhancement
6. Location Verification and Enrichment using Public APIs
Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that validates and enriches location data:
Location Verification API Integration

Primary API: Use Google Places API, OpenStreetMap Nominatim, or MapBox Geocoding API
Verification Process:

Query each location from the location field against the chosen API
Validate that locations exist and return standardized location data
Flag invalid or ambiguous locations for manual review
Store verified location data with coordinates (lat/lng)



RAG-Enhanced Location Intelligence
python# Example RAG integration flow
class LocationRAG:
    def verify_location(self, location_string: str) -> LocationVerification:
        # 1. Query public API for location validation
        # 2. Return structured location data with confidence score
        # 3. Store verified data for future lookups (retrieval component)
        # 4. Generate location insights using retrieved data
API Integration Requirements

Rate Limiting: Implement proper rate limiting for API calls
Caching: Cache verified locations to avoid redundant API calls
Fallback Strategy: Use multiple APIs for verification redundancy
Error Handling: Gracefully handle API failures or invalid responses

Enhanced Location Data Structure
python@dataclass
class VerifiedLocation:
    original_input: str
    verified_name: str
    coordinates: Tuple[float, float]
    country: str
    region: str
    confidence_score: float
    api_source: str
    verification_timestamp: datetime
RAG-Powered Trip Analysis Features

Location Standardization: Convert informal location names to standardized formats
Geographic Validation: Verify logical travel routes and flag impossible distances
Contextual Recommendations: Use location data to suggest nearby activities or cost benchmarks
Travel Distance Validation: Cross-check reported travel distances with actual geographic distances

Location Verification Output
Location Verification Report:
✓ "NYC" → New York City, NY, USA (lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060) [Confidence: 0.95]
✓ "Philly" → Philadelphia, PA, USA (lat: 39.9526, lng: -75.1652) [Confidence: 0.92]
⚠ "Smalltown" → Multiple matches found, manual verification needed
✗ "Fakecity" → No valid location found
API Integration Examples
python# Example API integrations for location verification
API_OPTIONS = {
    "nominatim": "https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search",
    "mapbox": "https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/",
    "google_places": "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/textsearch/json"
}
Bonus Features (Optional)

Trip budget vs. actual spending comparison
Cost per mile/kilometer analysis using travel distance data
Activity recommendation based on cost efficiency
Multi-trip comparison capabilities
Export to travel planning formats
RAG-powered travel recommendations based on verified location data
Currency conversion for international trips
Location-based cost benchmarking using crowd-sourced travel data

Advanced RAG Features

Travel Knowledge Base: Build a retrieval system of travel costs, activities, and tips for verified locations
Seasonal Cost Adjustments: Retrieve historical pricing data for locations based on travel dates
Local Insights Generation: Use LLM with retrieved location-specific data to generate travel insights
Crowd-sourced Validation: Compare user itineraries with community-verified location data

Build this tool focusing on the Pydantic model integration, accurate sequence validation, precise daily cost summation, and robust location verification through RAG-enhanced public API integration. The system should validate both the financial and geographic accuracy of travel itineraries.
